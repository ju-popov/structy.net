# hey programmer

Welcome to Structy! Watch the approach video in the tab at the top of this window to get started.

Write a function greet that takes in a string argument, s, and returns the string "hey s". No tricks here. Run the tests to check your work.

test_00:
```
greet("alvin") # -> "hey alvin"
```

test_01:
```
greet("jason") # -> "hey jason"
```

test_02:
```
greet("how now brown cow") # -> 'hey how now brown cow'
```
